## General info

This application was created with React.js and Google Maps API to calculate the route from point a to point b, display it on the map and calculate the time, distance and cost of reaching the destination.

To achieve this, I have used function component which contains several useState and useRef hooks. I created an asynchronous function to calculate distance and time, as well as a function to calculate cost and delete existing states. To properly handle google maps api I used a unique api key and defined variables such as directionsService and results. In addition, I created a navbar that allows you to move around the pages (I used a previously created navbar in a project called 'React-project-2' in my repo).
